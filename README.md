# Disable-Content-Security-Policy
A chrome extension that helps you disable or bypass Content Security Policy(CSP).

It is developed based on Manifest V3.

Google annouces that Manifest version 2 is deprecated, and support will be removed in 2023. See https://developer.chrome.com/blog/mv2-transition/ for more details.

That's one reason why the project borns.

The project use this <a href="https://github.com/PhilGrayson/chrome-csp-disable">repository</a> for reference.
